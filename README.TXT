Part IV
I will send the picture of the sun being blue and adding 2 suns

How to add 2 suns? Changed the sun1 color to blue by doing sun1.changeColor("blue");
Had to put private Circle sun2; after private Circle sun;
Had to add sun2.+ the method Ex. sun2.moveUp(); etc..

For the sunset I need to do this,
 } public void sunset() {
        sun.slowMoveVertical(300);
        sun.moveVertical(-300);
        drawn = true ;
    }
